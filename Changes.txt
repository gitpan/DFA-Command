Revision history for Perl extension DFA.

1.97  Sun Mar 23 11:29:00 2003
	- No source code changes in this version
	- Patch to stop shipping blib/ directory in Unix distros, because the
		PAUSE indexer takes this directory to indicate a binary distro,
		which means it does not index the module, and this in turn means
		the module is not listed in the CPAN daily update list, etc.

1.96  Sun May 12 13:12:11 2002
	- Clean up licence and email stuff in all modules, scripts and other docs.
