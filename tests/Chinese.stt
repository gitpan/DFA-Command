#
# Warning:
#	Some data lines have an abbreviation on them - commandList -
#	which is expanded in DFA::Command::load(). It expands
#	to a list of all events which are acceptable in commandState,
#	including the EOFEvent. This way, anyone editing this file
#	need not patch the validEvents field on any of those lines
#	when adding new commands.
#
# Note:
#	The following line names the fields on succeeding data lines.
